# Icon Preview

This mod lets you preview how your <cg>Cube</c> icon will look like in-game on top of your chosen <cp>Ship</c> and <co>UFO</c>!
To preview, simply enter the <cf>Icon Garage</c>, your selected cube will automatically show up in its position when you select a Ship/UFO icon!

By default, this mod does some funny stuff to ensure proper layering if ***Glow*** is enabled. If this causes any issues, this behavior can be disabled in the mod's settings page!

## Compatibility with other Icon Mods
- <cg>More Icons</c>: Should be completely compatible and functional!
- <co>Fine Outline</c>: Works, but cube won't have the custom outline color.
- <co>Separate Dual Icons</c>: Cube preview will only exist for Player 1. Proper compat planned in a future update!
